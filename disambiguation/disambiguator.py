"""
=== Purpose ===

The goal of this lab is to disambiguate entities in a text. For example, given a Wikipedia article:

    <Paris_17>
    Paris is a figure in the Greek mythology.

the goal is to determine that <Paris_17> = <Paris_(mythology)>.
Here, <Paris_17> is an artificial title of the Wikipedia article, and <Paris_(mythology)> is the unambiguous entity in the YAGO knowledge base.
(https://yago-knowledge.org/graph/%22Paris%22@en?relation=all&inverse=1)

=== Provided Data ===

We provide
1. a preprocessed version of the Simple Wikipedia wikipedia-ambiguous.txt, which contains ambiguous article titles with their content, as above.
2. a simplified version of the YAGO knowledge base.
3. a template for your code, disambiguator.py
4. a gold standard sample.

=== Task ===

Your task is to complete the function disambiguate() in this file.
It receives as input (1) the ambiguous Wikipedia title ("Paris" in the example), and (2) the article content.
The method shall return the unambiguous entity from YAGO.
In order to ensure a fair evaluation, do not use any non-standard Python libraries except nltk.
The lab will be graded by a variant of the F1 score that gives higher weight to precision (with beta=0.5).

Input:
<Babilonia_0>
Babilonia is a 1987 Argentine drama film directed and written by Jorge Salvador based on a play by Armando Disc√©polo.

Output:
<Babilonia_0> TAB <Babilonia>

=== Development and Testing ===

In YAGO, the entities have readable ids, as in <Ashok_Kumar_(British_politician)>. This is, however, not the case in all knowledge bases. Therefore, your algorithm should not rely on the suffix "British Politician"!

To enforce this, we deliver two versions of the lab:
1. Development: With readable entity ids
The corresponding YAGO knowledge base is dev_yago.tsv, and the gold standard is dev_gold_samples.tsv
2. Testing: Without readable entity ids
The corresponding YAGO knowledge base is test_yago.tsv. Here, the British politician has the id <Ashok_Kumar_1081507>. This is the file that you will be evaluated on!
   
=== Submission ===

1. Take your code, any necessary resources to run the code, and the output of your code on the test dataset (no need to put the other datasets!)
2. ZIP these files in a file called firstName_lastName.zip
3. submit it here before the deadline announced during the lab:
