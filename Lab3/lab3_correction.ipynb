It was specifically designed to provide an ideal setting for evaluating WSD models (e.g. no senses in test sets missing from training), both quantitavely and qualitatively.\n",

    "We're going to transform our data into *tokens* that BERT will then process into embeddings. We will use the tokenizer associated to a BERT-type model, via the ```transformers``` library (from Huggingface).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps we need to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The text need to be truncated if it's more than 256/512 tokens or padded if it's less than 256 or 512 tokens (depending on the model size). The words may also need to be separated into subword tokens: BERT-like models use different *tokenizers*, built to handle a fix-sized vocabulary. Any word that is not in the vocabulary is divided into subwords that are. BERT's tokenizer is based on *Wordpiece*. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. BERT uses special tokens, which will be added:\n",
    "    - [CLS] — Start token of every document\n",
    "    - [SEP] — Separator between each sentence \n",
    "    - [PAD] — Padding at the end of the document as many times as necessary, up to 256/512 tokens\n",
    "    - &#35;&#35; — Indicates the start of a subword, or \"word piece\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **DistilBERT** model to save space (as it is a distilled version of the full BERT model), and we will use the uncased version. We need to be careful to use the corresponding tokenizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each model that you plan to use, you should read the corresponding description in the documention - here for [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html)."

To make things simpler, since have one label by sequence, we will consider that our task is to classify the full sequence (and not the ambiguous word *taken in context* as before). We could probably stick to our previous setting by adapting it into a token classification task, but that may reveal difficult to do. "
